<p class="subtitle"> - Frequently asked Questions </p>


This channel serves a purpose of answering commonly asked questions to clarify some understandings towards the game & its development
--------------------

- ‚ÄùWhen is the update?‚Äù
* The update will always be announced to the public make sure to check the various channels used for those inquiries such as #news #shouts #polls #updates if they are not posted there then there is no update implemented

- ‚ÄùWhere are the codes?‚Äù
* Codes can always be found in #guide & via the trello these will show the new current codes and old expired ones

- ‚ÄùI‚Äôm new how do I play?‚Äù
* Again this can be found via #guide with more necessary info located in the Trello, The Trello can be found in #links

- ‚ÄùWhy was I warned?‚Äù
* As silly as this one sounds, it‚Äôs quite commonly asked, make sure to read the channel topic and the rules, pins, and guidelines set for each specific channel. Be also aware of #rulebook

- ‚ÄùHow do I appeal a ban/mute?‚Äù
* Ban appeals can always be found in #ban-appeals these have 2 different forms from a ban either from the game or the server itself. We don't entirely appeal mutes, it's best to wait out the punishment.
- ‚ÄùDo the Staff even do anything?‚Äù
* Why yes we do, many of you guys are curious if we the staff do anything at all, we monitor in game, make regulations, and set up perms & moderate the channels so you guys can enjoy yourself. Many things go on behind the public

- ‚ÄùDid the Developers give up?‚Äù
* No they didn‚Äôt, just like us they‚Äôre humans many unexpected things can come up preventing them from updating regularly many of them go to school and are working towards better education please be mindful.

- ‚ÄùHow do I report a bug/exploiter?‚Äù
* The various channels that hold these reports can be reported in #deleted-channel , #player & #exploit
If unable to use those channels please DM a Mod+

- ‚ÄùHow do I get my group posted in ‚ÄúOfficial Groups?‚Äù ‚Äú
* Following the regulations in each specific channel can help please check the pins and Dm a Mod+ For any more info

- Server Information


The following channel‚Äôs content will provide information about the server. Things such as FAQ, facts and just some information about the server itself.


When was the server created?

- The server was created 7/23/19

*Why was I warned? [EXPANDED]

- Each channel has a specific topic which may or may not have it‚Äôs own set of guidelines. You have most likely violated a rule in #rulebook thus you‚Äôve been warned. Remember to check each channel‚Äôs topic before questioning why you were warned.

How can I apply for Moderator?

- You don‚Äôt. Each one of our staff was either promoted from being a helper or was hand picked from previous applications. Now they are handpicked from a Community Mod+. Asking to get the role will most likely lower your chances of getting it.

Note; We **NO LONGER** do moderation applications but this is subject to change and it is not guaranteed you will be promoted to Mod if you passed Helper application

How do I become a Helper?

- You have to apply. Applications are most likely to pop up in #sub-announcements Helpers mainly answer questions for the game so if you think you‚Äôre keen enough with game knowledge you may apply for Helper

Where can I find game information?

- There are various channels that hold game information. Please head towards #links for the wikia plus other tools There are also videos in #xbear-game-videos for content revolving the game
